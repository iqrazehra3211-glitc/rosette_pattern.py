# Rosette Pattern using Python Turtle Graphics

This project generates a **rosette-style geometric pattern** using Python’s Turtle Graphics module.
The pattern is created by repeatedly drawing a square and rotating it by a fixed angle, resulting in a flower-like design.

## Features
- Creates a beautiful rosette (flower) pattern
- Uses rotational symmetry
- Beginner-friendly Python project
- Visual demonstration of loops and angles

## Concepts Used
- Python Turtle Graphics
- Nested `for` loops
- Rotation and angles
- Geometric symmetry

## How It Works
A square is drawn multiple times.
After each square, the turtle rotates slightly, forming a circular rosette pattern.
